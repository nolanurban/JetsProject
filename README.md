# Title
Jets Project

# Purpose
Allow use of the basics of OOP (APIE)

# Takeaways

I learned a lot more about abstraction in this program quite a bit.  

All fighter jets (concrete) are jets (abstract) but not all jets are fighter jets.  Unfortunately, in programming this is quite a bit
more specific; All jets can be parked in a hangar in real life, regardless of their class, but not in Java :). They have to be placed in 
the hangar as what they are.

Keeping keyboard open as a static throughout saves you time with opening, closing, and ultimately throwing a bunch of errors from Scanner.

foreach in combination with massive amounts of chaining works and is smart but looks confusing.

# Personal Thoughts & Goals

I need a lot more work with ArrayList, List <T>, and Set;  We covered this briefly and I will benefit from more lab time.
  
Parsing from a String to a String[] to a Array<String> has been like missing in racquetball.
  
StackOverflows problems are often too specific for actual use and I need to have a concrete understanding of relationships between different
objects.
  
# Notes about the program

This is a bare bones, user interface to access different classes.  If you try and break it, it will break.  I will work more on try and catch,
  conditionals that stop user abuse, and spending time creating a better framework before I begin coding.
